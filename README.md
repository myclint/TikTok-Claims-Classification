### **TikTok-Claims-Classification**
This end-of-course project for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate Program based on a fictional workplace scenario at TikTok. I helped the TikTok data team to develop a machine learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform.

In this repository, we seek a way to use machine learning to extract claims or propositions within TikTok videos and comments, and classify each data point as a claim or opinion.

## **Data**

The tiktok team was provided with the claims dataset.

## **Approach**

* The project was broken down into the following 6 tasks.
* Please refer to attached files for detailed explanations with code and corresponding executive summaries.

# * **Task 1 - Project Proposal**
* I prepared and submitted a project proposal to the TikTok leadership team for approval.

# * **Task 2 - Data Understanding**
* Once approval was received, I was given access to download the dataset.
* I then proceeded to inspect and understand the data in the data understanding stage to gain clear insights to prepare for a claims classification model.
* I prepared an executive summary to report my findings to the team at TikTok.

# * **Task 3 - EDA**
* I examined the provided dataset and prepared it for analysis.
* I also designed a professional data visualization that tells a story and will help data-driven decisions for business needs.
* I then proceeded to prepare an executive summary to share my results.

# * **Task 4 - Statistical Testing**
* I explored the data provided further and conducted a hypothesis testing.
* I then prepared an executive summary to share my results with stakeholders.

# * **Task 5 - Regression Modeling**
* I built a logistic regression model and evaluated the results.
* I then prepared an executive summary to share my results.

# * **Task 6 - Machine Learning Model**
* I built a machine learning model that predicts whether a TikTok claim presents a “claim” or presents an “opinion”.
* I then prepared an executive summary to share my final results with stakeholders.
